# $init method returns error if coltypes of cfactuals are different from coltypes of predictor$data$X

    Columns of `cfactuals` and `predictor$data$X` must have the same types.

# plot_parallel returns error for unknown feature names

    Assertion on 'feature_names' failed: Must be a subset of set {var_num_1,var_num_2,var_fact_1,var_fact_2}.

# evaluate returns error if measures are not known

    Assertion on 'measures' failed: Must be a subset of set {dist_x_interest,dist_target,no_changed,dist_train}.

# methods that require at least one counterfactuals are blocked when no counterfactuals found
